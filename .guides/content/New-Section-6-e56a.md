## length()
We'll introduce something really handy at this point. Because an array cna have any number of elements, it is very useful to be able to determine how many elements the array has.

`numArray.length` is a way of finding out exactly this. In our Flode chart we have 2 arrays

- `people` : an array of names of people
- `ages` : an array of their ages

We can found out how many people we have using this 

```javascript
people.length
```

`ages.length` would also return the same result as in this example we have a corresponding age for each person.
