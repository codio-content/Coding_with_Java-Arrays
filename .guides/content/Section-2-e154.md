## Array of numbers
In programming, you might want to work with a list of 10 numbers. Imagine there are 10 boxes, each of which contains a number.

- This set of boxes is the *array*
- The number on the box is the *array index*
- Each individual box is know as an *array element*
- The number contained within the box is the *element value*

The circled box is

- The 4th element in the array
- Its index is therefore `3`
- The element value is `51`

## The first element is 0 not 1
We might as well get used to this as it is the case in almost all programming languages.

The first array element has an index of 0, not 1. This will cause you to make mistakes early on but after a while it will become second nature.
