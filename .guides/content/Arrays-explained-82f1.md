We already dealt thoroughly with arrays in Flode. Here is a recap just for reference before we explain how to code them.

## Real World Analogy
A simple analogy is a row of 100 houses along one side of a street. Each house is numbered from 1 to 100. Inside each house there live a certain number of people. 

- 4 people live in house 1
- 2 people in house 24
- 5 people in house 54 
- etc.
