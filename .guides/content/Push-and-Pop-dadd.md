Javascript also has a couple of useful methods for adding elements to the end of an array.

{Run code}(node run-user.js ./1-arrays/push-pop.js)

## Push
`array.push(newElement)` is an often used way of adding a new element to the end of an array. Think "we are pushing a new element onto the end of the array".

## Pop
`array.pop()` removes the last element from the array. Think "we are popping an element off the end of the array".

Run the code and check you understand what is happening.
