One important thing you will need to know about arrays is the number of elements an array has.

{Run the code on the left}(node run-user.js ./content/1-arrays/example1.js)

If you look at the code on the left, you will see the following

```javascript
ages.length
```

This returns the number of elements in the array `ages`. 

You will often use this in loops so you can loop through all the elements in an array.
