Once ArrayLists have been declared, it is possible to execute several methods to manipulate its items.

## Add

`names.add("Mary");` is adding the string: "Mary" to the `names` ArrayList. 

One of the advantages of ArrayLists in Java is that they can grow in size as needed.

## Remove (by index)

`names.remove(0);` on the other hand, works by passing as a parameter, the index of the element to remove.

It is possible to remove the elements from the last index of the ArrayList by using the `names.size()` method and then substracting 1 from the total size or length of the ArrayList.
