Let's take a look at the Flode chart on the left hand side. We have 2 inputs in this chart and you can see how each of them has been defined as an array.

Each array has the same number of elements, so we can *iterate* through the array using a loop. 

## Length of an array
Notice that we are using a special *property* of the array, `length`. This tells us how many elements there are in the array.

## Accessing an array element
Note that `index` is our counter variable. Using our index, we can get the value of any individual array element.

If you look at the block containing `input1[index] + ' is ' + input0[index]`, you can see how we reference elements.

- `input1[0]` references the first element of `input1`, `'Richard'`.
- `input0[2]` references the 3rd element of `input0`, `68`.

## Play with the chart
Step through the chart and watch the variables and the console closely as you go. All should become clear.
