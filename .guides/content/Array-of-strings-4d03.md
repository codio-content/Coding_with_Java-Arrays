We can also have an array of strings. For example, the following is an array of people's first names.

`Richard, Alice, Jennifer, Bob, Harry, Susan`

So, Jennifer is ...

- The 3rd element in the array
- Its index is therefore `2` (the first element has index 0, remember)
- The element value is `Jennifer`
